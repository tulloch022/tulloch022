# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm an aspiring Test Automation Engineer passionate about creating efficient, scalable, and reliable test solutions using Playwright.

## About Me
I have been honing my skills in software testing and quality assurance through hands-on projects and self-driven learning. My focus is on building robust test automation frameworks that enhance development workflows and ensure software quality. Here are some of the skills and experiences Iâ€™ve developed through my projects:

- Writing and maintaining automated test scripts.
- Designing and executing test plans and test cases.
- Exploring CI/CD pipelines for integrating automated testing.
- Debugging and resolving test failures to maintain system reliability.
- Collaborating with mock workflows to simulate cross-functional teamwork.

## Featured Projects
